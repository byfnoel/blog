# All About Me

## Francisco Noel [Software Engineer]

My name is Francisco Noel. I am a software engineer and I have been programming
both professionally and as a hobby since 2018. I am also a computer science
student at the University of Massachusetts Boston.

### My Experience

I have extensive experience in backend and infrastructure systems where performance
and reliability are paramount. I have strong computer science fundamentals
and ability to move fast in new technical settings.

Previously, I've worked at various companies, both large and small,
such as American Express and Chevron.

### My Interests

My interests include systems programming (specially in Rust),
distributed systems, platform engineering, and developer tools.

I enjoy working on projects related to backend systems, infrastructure, build systems,
platform engineering, and developer tools.

As a Software Engineer, I like when I am somewhat involved in the whole life cycle
of a project, with opportunities to switch teams and projects
as I grow both as a person and an engineer and also the business grows and evolves.
Depending on the project, I’d want to be involved in research, design, planning,
architecture, development, test, implementation and release phases.

My main programming language is Rust. I also have experience with C/C++, and Python.
