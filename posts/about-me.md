# All About Me



## Francisco Noel [Software Engineer]

My name is Francisco Noel. I am a software engineer and I’ve been programming both professionally and as a hobby since 2018.

### My Experience
I have extensive experience in backend and infrastructure systems where performance and reliability are paramount. I have strong computer science fundamentals and ability to move fast in new technical settings.

Previously, I've worked at various companies, both large and small, such as American Express and Chevron.

For a period of time, I attended the School of Computing and Information Sciences at Florida International University where I studied Information Technology.

### My Interests
My interests include systems programming (specially in Rust), distributed systems, platform engineering, and developer tools.

I enjoy working on projects related to backend systems, infrastructure, build systems, platform engineering, DevOps pipelines, and developer tools. 

As a SWE, I like when I am somewhat involved in the whole lifecycle of a project, with opportunities to switch teams and projects as I grow both as a person and an engineer and also the business grows and evolves. Depending on the project, I’d want to be involved in research, design, planning, architecture, development, test, implementation and release phases.

My main programming language is Rust.
I also have experience in C, C++, and Python, as well as familiarity with Java.
